## Version Control
Version control is a process of creating different instances of a project in order to track changes in the project. Version control also allows us to rollback to a previous version in case of any issues with the project. With version control, different people can contribute to the project at once.

## Difference Between Git and GitHub.
__Git__ is a Version Control System. It is used for tracking, collaboration and also to revert to previous changes. It is used to take snapshots of our code.

__GitHub__ on the other hand is a remote repository used to house our code source files, also keeping track of the different versions and branches. GitHub is also used to host our projects.

While both are different, and can work independently, they mostly are used side by side, because as a unit, its a powerful tool in the hands of a developper.
